    <p> The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt came out in 2015 and to this day it's still has an enormous and gorgeous open world to do whatever the hell you feel like doing as long as the game allows it (or you just mod it if you're on pc :p). I like this game a lot for the fact that although it's the third game in the series, because it was the first game to be open world it was created in a way so that even newcomers could get into the series even if they hadn't played the previous games. (Witcher 2 is worth playing according to people who have played it, but the first game is dated and feels kind of crappy). And either way, although the story is awesome there is sooooooo much more. The sidequests really feel like their own game sometimes with how some of them develop (not kidding) and Geralt is a seriously awesome protagonist who is clear on what he cares about and what he believes in.</p>

      <p> Ahh, Nier:Automata. My cousin played this before me and I remember him losing his mind after he finished it and begged me to play it (even though I was going to anyways). So I got the game, and there are 5 endings. Now the first two endings are the same story route except one is told from the perspective of android 2B (route A) and the other is told by android 9S(route B). Now don't let the 5 main endings thing fool you. Route C is actually a continuation of the story from route A and B, aka it's the other half of the friggin game where there's like hella plot twists n stuff that you DO NOT want to miss because when I went through it my jaw was on the floor and I was screaming. The story is wild full of twists and turns, a desolate world with nothing but the androids, machines, and wildlife left with humanity still on the moon and not making appearences on earth. It's hard to say anything without spoiling but just know that the director of the game Yoko Taro is known for writing great stories that are also extremely dark (Like the dude literally has no faith in humanity and doesn't believe we'll ever stop killing eachother) so you can except yourself to scream, cry, and be depressed for a few days because of feels. </p>

        <h3 class="yellow">The Best Challanging Dark Fantasy: Bloodborne</h3>

       <p>  Bloodborne. A From Software game. Tl;Dr it's the same studio as Dark Souls so as you can expcet, the game is hard. Very hard. You will see you died screens, blood, walking flesh, darkness, and a really creepy doll who you can buy stuff from. Oh, and you drink blood to regain hp which is totally normal amirite? Now I haven't finished this game yet but considering the game so far, there is no doubt that it is a fantastic game. Enemies, especially so for bosses, are challenging and always keep you on your toes. You have a small, but pretty good selection of weaponry with the melee weapons having a short/fast weapon form and a long/heavy weapon form, and a gun in the left hand which is only useful to stun enemies so that you can get a critical hit on them (though that's also pretty useful, just that you need to get the timing perfect). Not much else to say. Fun, challenging, can play with friends, if you like hard games that are fast paced this is the game for you, trust me.</p>

        <p> Soundtrack award was hard. I have a lot of games I could put but I wanted to limit it to games that are easy to get into, and games that only have a Japanese release (lol). The OST is very atmospheric, meaning that a lot of the soundtracks will make you have an emotional reaction. Tracks that play during action get you excited, traveling through city ruins for example, you can feel the desolate open surrounding you through the soundtrack, and when you're in a desolate forest again, it just makes you feel a certain type of way. I listen to some of these tracks and sometimes tear up if that's any testament to how good they are (especially when I take story context) so uh yeah, one of the best tracks in a vidieo game series ever (like seriously).</p>
